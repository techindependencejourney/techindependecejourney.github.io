<P>Lets just cut to the chase, big tech companies like Google are constantly harvesting <b>your data</b> for money. Yes, they are getting your privacy for money.</P>
<br>
<p>Dont believe me? According to <a href="https://is.gd/I2PdDf" target="_blank">this</a> article from the Associated Press, Google tracks your location at 
all times, whetever you like it or not. And Facebook <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ways-facebook-tracks-you-limit-it/">unfairly</a> tracks all of your data.</p>
<p>To summarize these sources and Google's own <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">privacy policy</a>, these are what big tech collects.</p>
<ol>
<li>Location</li>
<li>Payment Methods</li>
<li>Personal Information</li>
<li>Browser History</li>
<li>Private Emails</li>
<li>Voice and audio information</li>
<li>People who you contact with</li>
<li>IP Address<reli>
<li>Unique identifiers (identifiers for you only)</li>
<li>Everything you search</li>
<li>Activity on third party sites that use Google's services</li>
<li>Your GPS and other sensor data.</li>
<br>
</ol>
<P>This is just a list of what Google collects, other big tech companies or social media will also have similar policies but all you need to know is that big tech collects most of the data that was listed.</P>
