<h1>Emails</h1>
<p>These are a list of emails we recommend. Note that these are <b>not categorized in order.</b></p>

<h2>1: <a href="https://tutanota.com/" target="_blank">Tutanota</a></h2>
<p>Tutanota is one of the best emails compared to Gmail. Here is why we would recommend this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Supports end-to-end encryption emails</li>
<Li>Open source</Li>
<li>Supports iOS and Android</li>
<li>Two-factor authentication</li>
<li>Ad-free</li>
<li>Easy to use</li>
<li>Privacy-friendly</li>
<li>Based in Germany, with a lot of strict privacy laws.</li>
<li>Affordable pricing.</li>


</ol>
<p>There is alot to like about tutanota. It being based in germany means it is very strict about privacy, its easy to use and affordable pricing for teams. It is ad-free so you wont be seeing any ads, and it is end to end encrypted. Overall, this proves to be an awesome alternative to Gmail.</p>


<h2>2: <a href="https://proton.me/mail" target="blank">ProtonMail</a></h2>

<ol>
<li>End-to-end encryption</li>
<li>Open Source</li>
<li>Two-factor authentication</li>
<li>Based in switzerland, which has strong privacy laws</li>
<li>Secure messaging </li>
<li>Supports Android and iOS</li>
</ol>

<p>ProtonMail is also really good. Supports Android and iOS, secure messaging, based in switzerland and end-to-end encryption. However, it comes with less storage though. But ProtonMail overall is a good alternative to Gmail</p>
    </div>

    <h1>Email Alias</h1>

    <p>Email Aliases are to hide your actual email and replace it with an alias. Instead of your brand new tutanota email, you have an alias instead.</p>

    <h2>1: <a href="https://anonaddy.com/" target="blank">Anonaddy</a></h2>

<p>Anonaddy is a really good email alias, and this is why we would recommend it:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Open source</li>
    <li>Unlimited Alias</li>
    <li>Custom Alias</li>
    <li>Easy to use/user friendly</li>
    <li>Encryped email forwarding</li>
    <li>Free and paid plans</li>
    <li>Manage all aliases, domains, etc.</li>

    <p>Anonaddy is a good email alias with encrypted email, open source, custom alias, and very managable. However because of anonaddy's popularity, some sites when you sign up with Anonaddy, it is not valid. However it is still a good email alias.</p>
</ol>

<h2>2: <a href="https://simplelogin.io/" target="blank">Simplelogin</a></h2>


<p>Simplelogin, another email alias is also a good one compared to anonaddy. We recommend this because:</p>

<ol>
<li>Send emails from alias</li>
<li>Manage from anywhere</li>
<li>Custom domain</li>
<li>Free and paid</li>
<li>Easy to use and user friendly</li>
<li>Encrypted with PGP</li>
<li>Apart of proton.</li>

<p>Simplelogin is good with its customizable and easy to use controls. You can be private and secure in no more than 3 clicks. However it is is not fully encrypted. But overall, it is a good email alias.</p>
<br>

<p>This concludes our list of emails and email aliases. We totally recommend using this email alternatives instead of Gmail.</p>
