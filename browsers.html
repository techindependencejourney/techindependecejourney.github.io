<h1>Browsers to use</h1>
<p>Disclaimer, these are not in order on which we prefer the most.</p>

<h2>1: <a href="https://brave.com/" target="blank">Brave</a></h2>
<p>Brave is a really good browser and it has a built in ad blocker (that doesn't steal your data) and is actually reliable.</p>
<p>We recommend brave because:</p>
<ol>
<LI>You can import google chrome data if you switch</LI>
<li>It has script blocking</li>
<li>It is open source</li>
<li>It blocks ads </li>
<li>You can block cookies with it</li>
<li>You can choose of a more strict tracking protection.</li>
<li>It is user friendly</li>
<li>It supports incognito Tor tabs.</li>
<li>You can sync Google Chrome and Brave.</li>
</ol>

<p>Brave doesn't have the best reputation for its crypto because its crypto does steal your data.</p>
<p>My tip is just to avoid the other services that brave offers. However brave is a pretty good browser that works and is faster than Google Chrome.</p>

<h2>2: <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/" target="blank">Firefox</a></h2>

<p>Firefox is also a good alternative to Google Chrome, offering something similar to Ungoogled Chromium.</p>
<p>We recommend Firefox because:</p>
<ol>
<li>It doesn't collect as much data as google</li>
<li>You can use hardend firefox. (Just a more secure version of firefox.)</li>
<li>It doesn't take up alot of resources</li>
<li>It is user friendly</li>
<li>You can choose of a more strict tracking protection</li>
<li>Easily sync firefox between all devices</li>
<li>It is open source</li>
<li>Has alot of options for plugins and extensions</li>
<li>Very customizable</li>
</ol>
<p>Firefox is really good, it has alot of adblockers and privacy protection. Overall, its an amazing alternative to Google Chrome.</p>
