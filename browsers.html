<h1>Browsers to use</h1>
<p>Disclaimer, these are not in order on which we prefer the most.</p>

<h2>1: <a href="https://brave.com/" target="blank">Brave</a></h2>
<p>Brave is a really good browser and it has a built in ad blocker (that doesn't steal your data) and is actually reliable.</p>
<p>We recommend brave because:</p>
<ol>
<LI>You can import google chrome data if you switch</LI>
<li>It has script blocking</li>
<li>It is open source</li>
<li>It blocks ads </li>
<li>You can block cookies with it</li>
<li>You can choose of a more strict tracking protection.</li>
<li>It is user friendly</li>
<li>It supports incognito Tor tabs.</li>
<li>You can sync Google Chrome and Brave.</li>
</ol>

<p>Brave doesn't have the best reputation for its crypto because its crypto does steal your data and its been involved in many scandals, and crypto ponzi schemes</p>
<p>My tip is just to avoid the other services that brave offers. However brave is a pretty good browser that works and is faster than Google Chrome.</p>

<h2>2: <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/" target="blank">Firefox</a></h2>

<p>Firefox is also a good alternative to Google Chrome, offering something similar to Ungoogled Chromium.</p>
<p>We recommend Firefox because:</p>
<ol>
<li>It doesn't collect as much data as google</li>
<li>You can use hardend firefox. (Just a more secure version of firefox.)</li>
<li>It doesn't take up alot of resources</li>
<li>It is user friendly</li>
<li>You can choose of a more strict tracking protection</li>
<li>Easily sync firefox between all devices</li>
<li>It is open source</li>
<li>Has alot of options for plugins and extensions</li>
<li>Very customizable</li>
</ol>
<p>Firefox is really good, it has alot of adblockers and privacy protection. Overall, its an amazing alternative to Google Chrome. However it isn't as good as our next alternative:</p>

<h2>3: <a href="https://librewolf.net/">Librewolf</a></h2>
<p>Librewolf is by far one of the best alternatives to Google Chrome, if not the best alternative.</p>
<p>We highly recommend Librewolf because:</p>
<ol>
<li>No Telemetry</li>
<li>Private Search</li>
<li>Adblockers preinstalled</li>
<li>Pre-hardened</li>
<li>User-friendly</li>
<li>Open Source</li>
<li>Customizable</li>
<li>Disables WebGL</li>
<li>Zero Fingerprinting</li>
<li>Deletes search history and cookies</li>
</ol>
<p>Librewolf is really good, and in terms of privacy, it is better than firefox, it comes pre-loaded with the software you need to keep yourself private and secure online.</p>

<h2>4: <a href="https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium#downloads" target="_blank">Ungoogled Chromium</a></h2>
<p>Ungoogled Chromium is a great alternative to Google Chrome, however it is not user friendly.</p>
<li>No Telemetry</li>
<li>Cookie Blocking</li>
<li>Similar to Chrome</li>
<li>Uses Chrome Extensions</li>
<li>Open Source</li>
<Li>You can import</Li>
<li>Anti Fingerprinting</li>
<li>Doesn't take up alot of resources</li>

<p>Ungoogled Chromium is a good alternative to Google Chrome, however you need to add ad-blocking as it does not come in default. You also need some <a href="https://crxextractor.com/" target="_blank">crx extractor</a> to install extensions.</p>
