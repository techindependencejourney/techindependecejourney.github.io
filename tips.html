    <h3>What is this page about?</h3>
    <p>The tips page is meant to give you tips (crazy, i know) on how you can do your own research. On this page, we will give you websites on how to further increase your privacy online!</p>

    <h2>1: <a href="https://alternativeto.net/" target="blank">AlternativeTo</a></h2>
    <p><b>Description: </b>This website is very useful for finding alternatives to big tech, for example Google Drive, Google Docs, etc. This website tells you whether something is open-source or proprietary, if its free, free but with a premium to gain access to other features (freemium), and paid.  </p>
    <br>
    <h2>2: <a href="https://tosdr.org/en" target="blank">TOSDR</a></h2>
    <p><b>Description: </b>Short for "Terms of Service Didn't Read", TOSDR is a website that summarizes privacy policies of software, most notably big tech. Privacy policies are very long and is probably made intentionally to be like that so you wont bother reading it. That's where TOSDR comes in and tells you what the privacy policy says in short sentences. You can find additional information about what each sentence means by viewing details.</p>
      <br>
    <h2>3 <a href="https://searx.org/" target="blank">Searching it up</a></h2>
    <p><b>Description: </b>Okay, i know this will certainly blow your mind. Searching software up is very useful because you can find useful bits of information that places like TOSDR, AlternativeTo and other websites haven't gotten to yet.</p>
