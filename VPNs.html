<h1>What are VPNs?</h1>
<p>VPNs, (Virtual Private Networks) is a tool that can hide you IP address and tunnel your traffic to a remote server securely. Lots of people use VPNs to be anonymous and avoid getting tracked. This list is going to show open source, trusted VPNs you can use.</p>
<p>Why are we recommending you alternatives to giants like NordVPN? Well just as it turns out, NordVPN collects data, and so does surfshark and other giant VPN companies. For example, when you talk to the ChatBot, it collects data about you. They also collect access logs. These logs can be kept for the next 5 minutes or the next 3 months.<p>
    <p>Other VPN's, like Surfshark, have similar policies but they are slightly different. More information about NordVPN can be found <a href="https://my.nordaccount.com/legal/privacy-policy/" target="blank">here.</a></p>

<h2>1: <a href="https://protonvpn.com/" target="_blank">ProtonVPN</a></h2>
<p>ProtonVPN is a popular, secure and private VPN that alot of people use. We think it is the best alternative to Surfshark, or NordVPN. We would recommend this to you because:</p>
<ol>
<li>P2P support</li>
<li>Doesn't track you</li>
<li>Doesn't use trackers</li>
<li>Will not share information with third parties.</li>
<li>Completely free</li>
<li>Open source</li>
<li>Unblocks content (like for streaming services)</li>
<li>Over 1000 servers</li>
<li>Good downloading speeds.</li>
</ol>    
<p>ProtonVPN in conclusion is a really good VPN, with it being open source, completely free and basically zero tracking, we think this is a good VPN.</p>
<p>Though be warned that it could be slow and potientally crash.</p>
