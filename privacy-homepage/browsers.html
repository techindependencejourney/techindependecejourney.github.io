<h1>Browsers to use</h1>
<p>Disclaimer, these are not in order on which we prefer the most.</p>

<h2>1: <a href="https://brave.com/" target="blank">Brave</a></h2>
<p>Brave is a really good browser and it has a built in ad blocker (that doesn't steal your data) and is actually reliable.</p>
<p>We recommend brave because:</p>
<ol>
<LI>You can import google chrome data if you switch</LI>
<li>It has script blocking</li>
<li>It is open source</li>
<li>It blocks ads </li>
<li>You can block cookies with it</li>
<li>You can choose of a more strict tracking protection.</li>
<li>It is user friendly</li>
<li>It supports incognito Tor tabs.</li>
<li>You can sync Google Chrome and Brave.</li>
</ol>

<p>Brave doesn't have the best reputation for its crypto because its crypto does steal your data and its been involved in many scandals, and crypto pyramid schemes. It also takes up lots of RAM like Google Chrome.</p>
<p>My tip is just to avoid the other services that brave offers. However brave is a pretty good browser that works and is faster than Google Chrome.</p>

<h2>2: <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/" target="blank">Firefox</a></h2>

<p>Firefox is also a good alternative to Google Chrome, offering something similar to Ungoogled Chromium.</p>
<p>We recommend Firefox because:</p>
<ol>
<li>It doesn't collect as much data as google</li>
<li>You can use hardend firefox. (Just a more secure version of firefox.)</li>
<li>It doesn't take up alot of resources</li>
<li>It is user friendly</li>
<li>You can choose of a more strict tracking protection</li>
<li>Easily sync firefox between all devices</li>
<li>It is open source</li>
<li>Has alot of options for plugins and extensions</li>
<li>Very customizable</li>
</ol>
<p>Firefox is really good, it has alot of adblockers and privacy protection, open source, customizable, easily being able to sync, and etc, makes Firefox a great alternative to Google Chrome.</p>

<h2>3: <a href="https://librewolf.net/">Librewolf</a></h2>
<p>Librewolf is by far one of the best alternatives to Google Chrome, if not the best alternative.</p>
<p>We highly recommend Librewolf because:</p>
<ol>
<li>No Telemetry</li>
<li>Private Search</li>
<li>Adblockers preinstalled</li>
<li>Pre-hardened</li>
<li>User-friendly</li>
<li>Open Source</li>
<li>Customizable</li>
<li>Disables WebGL</li>
<li>Zero Fingerprinting</li>
<li>Deletes search history and cookies</li>
</ol>
<p>Librewolf is really good, and in terms of privacy, it is better than firefox, it comes pre-loaded with the software you need to keep yourself private and secure online such as anti-fingerprinters, pre hardened, and even comes with an anti tracker and adblocker. Overall, an awesome alternative to Google Chrome.</p>

<h2>4: <a href="https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium#downloads" target="_blank">Ungoogled Chromium</a></h2>
<p>Ungoogled Chromium is a great alternative to Google Chrome, however it is not user friendly.</p>
<ol>
<li>No Telemetry</li>
<li>Cookie Blocking</li>
<li>Similar to Chrome</li>
<li>Uses Chrome Extensions</li>
<li>Open Source</li>
<Li>You can import</Li>
<li>Anti Fingerprinting</li>
<li>Doesn't take up alot of resources</li>
</ol>
<p>Ungoogled Chromium is a good alternative to Google Chrome, however you need to add ad-blocking as it does not come in default. You also need some <a href="https://crxextractor.com/" target="_blank">crx extractor</a> to install extensions.</p>
<br>
<h1>Mobile Browsers</h1>
<p>These are all recommended mobile browsers we recommend you use. </p>

<h2>Android Browsers</h2>
<p>These are recommendations for Android users.</p>



<h3>1: <a href="https://bromite.org" target="_blank">Bromite</a></h3>

<p> Bromite is a very good alternative to Google Chrome, acting very similar to it.
<ul>
<li>Pre-installed ad blocker</li>
<li>Similar to Google</li>
<Li>User-friendly</Li>
<li>Built-in Privacy Enhancements
<li>Anti Fingerprinting</li>
<li>Strict Protection Option</li>
<li>Cookie Blocking</li>
<li>Open source</li>
</ul>

<p>Bromite is a good browser, it is open source, blocks cookies, anti fingerpritning, and somewhat similar to google, makes it a good alternative for you Android users!<p>

<h3>2: <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/" target="_blank">Firefox</a></h3>

<p>Firefox is also an option for android. We recommend this browser again because: </p>
<ul>
    <li>It doesn't collect as much data as google</li>
    <li>It doesn't take up alot of resources</li>
    <li>It is user friendly</li>
    <li>You can choose of a more strict tracking protection</li>
    <li>Easily sync firefox between all devices</li>
    <li>It is open source</li>
    <li>Has alot of options for plugins and extensions</li>
    <li>Very customizable</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Firefox for android is just as limitless as its PC counterpart, however you can not get hardened firefox on it.</p>

    <h3>3: <a href="https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium#downloads" target="_blank">Ungoogled Chromium</a></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>No Telemetry</li>
        <li>Cookie Blocking</li>
        <li>Similar to Chrome</li>
        <li>Uses Chrome Extensions</li>
        <li>Open Source</li>
        <Li>You can import</Li>
        <li>Anti Fingerprinting</li>
        <li>Doesn't take up alot of resources</li>
        </ul>


<P>Ungoogled Chromium is also a good one, with anti fingerprinting, importing data and no telemetry makes it a good browser compared to Google Chrome.<P>

<h2>iOS Browsers</h2>

<h3>1: <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browsers/mobile/focus/" target="_blank">Firefox Focus</a></h3>

<p>Firefox Focus is a more secure version of Firefox, we recommend this because:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pages load faster</li>
<li>Automatic blocking ads and tracking</li>
<li>Less resources</li>
<Li>More secure</Li>
<li>Cookie Blocking</li>
<li>User friendly</li>
<li>Open source</li>
</ul>

<p>We recommend this browser, however there aren't any extensions and lots of things are sacrified for privacy and security. Making it limitless and not very customizable.</p>

<h3>2: <a href="https://brave.com" target="_blank">Brave</a></h3>
<ul>
    <LI>You can import google chrome data if you switch</LI>
    <li>It has script blocking</li>
    <li>It is open source</li>
    <li>It blocks ads </li>
    <li>You can block cookies with it</li>
    <li>You can choose of a more strict tracking protection.</li>
    <li>It is user friendly</li>
    <li>It supports incognito Tor tabs.</li>
    <li>You can sync Google Chrome and Brave.</li>
    <li>You can download videos</li>
</ul>

<p>Brave, also being similar to its PC counterpart however again, with some limitations, and also be careful with the ponzi schemes. Brave is still a good browser, however use with caution. Also do note, that brave takes up lots of RAM.</p>

<br>
<p>Google Chrome is also known for taking up lots of RAM, however alternatives like Firefox and Librewolf will not only save you RAM, but it will also make you more private online.</p>
