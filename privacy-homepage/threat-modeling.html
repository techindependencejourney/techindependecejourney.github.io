<p> Today we will teach you one of the fundementals to know during your journey to become more private and secure. <i><strong> Threat Modeling.</strong></i>
  Threat Modeling is a very important fundemental in your journey, because it tells you what your <i>boundaries</i> are. These boundaries will allow you to
  see what you want to use and do without tampering your everyday life. I will attempt to generalize this by making three areas that most people want to be in. These are:
  <ol>
    <li>Hiding information from friends</li>
    <li>Hiding information from corporations (where we <i>want</i> most people to be)</li>
    <li>Hiding from governments (extreme)</li>
  </ol>

If you do this, when chatting with like minded people on privacy, you can see what <i>you</i> want to improve, and what to leave alone.

Anyways, I will explain (in basic terms) what you would do for each "area". So, if you just want to hide stuff from friends, this is really simple. You can simply:

<ul>
<li>Change your passwords to be strong.</li>
<li>Only keeping in to devices you own</li>
<li>Turn off location (please do not have Snap Map on)</li>
</ul>

For the second area <i>(so for most people)</i>, you can:
<ul>
<li>Switch to privacy-respecting alternatives for everything (including marketplaces like Amazon)</li>
<li>Use <a href="VPNs.html" target="_blank">VPNs</a></li>
<li>Use a Pre-Paid Cell Phone plan (recommendations coming soon)</li>
<li>Freezing your credit</li>
<li>Remove all PII about you online</li>
</ul>
  </p>

For the third area, just read this <a href="https://www.cupwire.com/threat-modeling/" target="_blank">Cupwire</a> article about it. We have dipped our toes into it, but we are not experienced enough to cover this
alone (yet.)
